# ivoa-cutout-poc

This is a proof-of-concept variant of [vo-cutouts](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/vo-cutouts).
It performs the same actions, but uses an experimental JSON-based protocol designed for compatibility with current web development frameworks such as FastAPI.
It attempts to address most of the issues documented in [SQR-063](https://sqr-063.lsst.io/).

ivoa-cutout-poc is developed with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) and [Safir](https://safir.lsst.io).
